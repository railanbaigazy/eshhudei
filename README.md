This is one of my first-ever commercial websites, I made it in 2019 and earned $200. I decided to make it public on GitHub after a year by unknown reasonsðŸ¤”
No matter how bad it may seem compared to today's designs, I feel very proud of this one because it reflects the beginning of my journey. 

That's why I pinned it. 
A shout-out to my classmates for whom I completed school web projects for $10 each. You're the ones who gave me motivation and hunger.

Keep pushing, Railan.
